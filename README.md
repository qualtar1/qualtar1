Hello, I’m @qualtar1. 

I teach maths at Aston University in Birmingham UK but I would like to teach maths to anyone in the world who wants to learn. 
So far I have developed a python web app called Babbage (it's an analytical engine) that my student use to answer weekly tutorial questions. 
I'm in the process of rewriting Babbage in Rust and plan to make it globally available at no cost to users.

I would die happy if a young student, girl or boy, in a troubled area of the world used Babbage to get to university.

Contact me if you could share my dream.
